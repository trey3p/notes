\subsection{Equalities}

\begin{definition}
  Definitional equality is a syntactic notion of equality decided by the normalization or reduction rules of a type theory. If two terms are definitionally equal, they can be freely substituted for eachother in any context without changing the meaning of the program.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Propositional equality is a semantic notion of equality that is a proposition or type in the type theory. Two terms are propositionally equal if there exists a proof or a witness inhabiting a type expressing propositional equality between the two terms.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  Definitional equality is automated in Agda through the normalization of terms, while proving propositional equality is a task for the user. Definitional equality is a stronger notion than propositional equality and is usually decidable.The main distinction is that definitional equality is a syntactic notion built into the type theory, while propositional equality is a semantic notion expressed within the type theory itself.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Path Induction}

\subsection{Contractible Types}

\begin{definition}
  The type $\A$ is \emph{contractible} if it comes equipped with an element of the type
  \begin{equation*}
    is-Contr(A) =: \Sigma_{(c : A)}\Pi_{(x : A)} a = x
  \end{equation*}

  Given $(c, C) : is-Contr(A)$, $c : A$ is the \emph{center of contraction} for $A$ and $C : \Pi_{(x : A)}$ is the \emph{contraction of $A$}.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}[Intuition]
  A type is contractible if there exists $a : A$ such that for every term $x : A$, there is a path $p : a = x$. We can say that a type is contractible if it is equivalent to the unit type, $\mathbf{1}$. A contractible type can be thought of as a type that contains only one unique element up to homotopy $\mathbf{[?]}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Properties]
  A few points about contractible types:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All contractible types are equivalent to each other and the unit type.

    \item Contractible types are a terminal object in the category of types and functions.

    \item The path space between any two elements in a contractible type is itself contractible
  \end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Examples]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The unit type, $\mathbf{1}$, is contractible.

    \item The type $\Sigma_{(a : A)} A$ is contractible for any type $A$. This type represents the idea of a pointed type, where $a : A$ serves as the distinguished point $\mathbf{[?]}$.

    \item The type of paths between two equal terms $x = x$ is contractible for any $x : A$.

  \end{itemize}
\end{remark}
